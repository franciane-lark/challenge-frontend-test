# Frontend test

We have a simple API that returns a JSON array. We would like you to use HTML, CSS and Javascript to read the API and display it in an organized way. In addition, you should add in some sort of sorting and filtering mechanic to the front-end. Feel free to use any frameworks you would like to achieve the task.

## API

* */* returns all data;
* */random/<n>* returns a random subset of the data. Use this if you need a smaller dataset;

# Comandos:
- Terminal bash:
